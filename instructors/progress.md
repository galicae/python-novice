# Progress tracker

This is an internal document meant to help me keep track of changes I am making.

| date | episode | change |
|-|-|-|
| 2025-08-09 | misc | removing all the nice legal/organisational things done by the Carpentries teams because I don't need them and there are too many files. |
| 2025-08-09 | backend | Installed dependencies, loosely following [instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#mac). R is from homebrew; Rstudio was installed as a binary; installed `sandpaper`, `varnish`, and `pegboard` via terminal R. This does not work; linker issues. |
| 2025-08-10 | backend | cleaned up all R/Rstudio from my computer and swapped to conda; now it works like a charm. `sandpaper::serve()` now works as expected. |
| 2025-08-14 | episodes | renaming episodes |
| 2025-08-14 | profiles | summarising pre-course questionnaires for learner profile. |
