# Progress tracker

This is an internal document meant to help me keep track of changes I am making.

| date | episode | change |

| 2025-08-09 | misc | removing all the nice legal/organisational things done by the Carpentries teams because I don't need them and there are too many files. |
| 2025-08-09 | backend | Installed dependencies, loosely following [instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/sandpaper-docs/#mac). R is from homebrew; Rstudio was installed as a binary; installed `sandpaper`, `varnish`, and `pegboard` via terminal R. This does not work; linker issues. |
